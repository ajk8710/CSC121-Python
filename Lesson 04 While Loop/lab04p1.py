"""
Diabetes is diagnosed by measuring patientâ€™s fasting plasma glucose level (FPG).
If FPG is higher than 125, the patient has diabetes.
If FPG is higher than 100 but not higher than 125, the patient has pre-diabetes.
FPG 100 or lower is considered as a healthy level.
Write a program to do diabetes diagnosis for multiple patients.
For each patient, enter FPG and determine whether the patient has diabetes, pre-diabetes or a healthy FPG level.
Ask the user to answer a yes/no question to indicate whether he/she wants to do diagnosis for another patient.

Example:
Enter fasting plasma glucose level: 126
This patient has diabetes

Checking diabetes for another patient? [y/n] y
Enter fasting plasma glucose level: 97
This patient has healthy fpg level
